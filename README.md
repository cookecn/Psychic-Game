# About
* Psychic-Game is my third homework assignment for the Vanderbilt University Coding Bootcamp. This project was to create a psychic game using javascript, to allow the user and the computer to guess a letter and attempt to match the numbers. If the user matches with the computer, the user wins. There are 9 attempts.
